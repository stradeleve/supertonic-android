# Supertonic Android Application

## Project Overview
This directory contains the complete **Android application** for Supertonic, a high-performance, on-device text-to-speech (TTS) system. It demonstrates how to integrate the Supertonic ONNX models into a mobile app using Kotlin and JNI.

The application serves two main purposes:
1.  **Standalone TTS Player:** A user-friendly, immersive interface to type/paste text, select voices, and generate speech instantly.
2.  **System TTS Service:** Implements the Android `TextToSpeechService` API, allowing Supertonic to be used as the system-wide TTS engine.

## Key Features
*   **Offline Inference:** Runs entirely on-device using ONNX Runtime.
*   **Multilingual Support:** Native support for **English, Korean, Spanish, Portuguese, and French**.
*   **v2.0.0-alpha.1 Stable Pipeline:** Robust integration of the Supertonic V2 engine with specific fixes for audio distortion and cross-language switching.
*   **Automatic Language Detection:** Smart regex-based per-sentence detection allowing seamless reading of mixed-language text.
*   **Gapless Playback:** Implements a Producer-Consumer pipeline to synthesize the next sentence while the current one plays, eliminating latency between sentences.
*   **Material Design 3 (Expressive):** Modern, coherent UI with dynamic semantic colors and dark mode support.
*   **UI Localization:** The interface automatically adapts to the system language (English, Korean, Spanish, Portuguese, French).
*   **Edge-to-Edge Support:** Optimized for Android 15/16 system insets and curved displays.
*   **Digital Volume Boost:** Built-in 2.5x gain with hard-clipping protection for significantly louder audio output.
*   **User Pronunciation Dictionary (Lexicon):** Custom rules to correct or change how specific terms are pronounced, including Import/Export support via JSON.
*   **AIDL Architecture:** Robust inter-process communication (IPC) for both internal playback and third-party app integration (e.g., eBook readers).
*   **Smart Audio Focus:** Intelligently handles system interruptions (notifications, calls), resuming only if the interruption was transient and not a manual user pause.
*   **Immersive Reader:** Distraction-free playback interface with text highlighting.
*   **Audio Export:** Save synthesized speech as WAV files to the Music directory.
*   **Rich Media Controls:** Native Android media notification with album art, play/pause, and metadata.
*   **History:** Tracks recent synthesis requests.

## Architecture

### Stability Fixes (v2)
- **Token Filtering:** The JNI/Rust layer now maps unknown character indices (-1) to 0 (Space) to prevent digital "blending" noise caused by the V2 model's specific indexer requirements.
- **Preprocessing:** Correctly handles **NFKD decomposition** for Hangul and Latin accents, ensuring the engine receives the expected phonetic components.
- **Language Signaling:** Uses unconditional `<lang>` tags to ensure the V2 engine correctly switches between its trained language models.
- **System TTS Fix:** Restored support for apps like **Readera** by implementing explicit 3-letter ISO code declarations and advertising Supertonic voices across all supported locales.

### Voice Personas
Voices are treated as "Personas" that work across all supported languages.
*   **Male:** Alex (M1), James (M2), Robert (M3), Sam (M4), Daniel (M5)
*   **Female:** Sarah (F1), Lily (F2), Jessica (F3), Olivia (F4), Emily (F5)

### Core Components
*   **Audio Pipeline (`PlaybackService`)**: Uses a Kotlin Coroutine `Channel` (capacity 2) to buffer synthesized audio. The "Producer" coroutine synthesizes sentences ahead of time and applies a **2.5x digital gain**, while the "Consumer" loop plays them using `AudioTrack` in `MODE_STATIC` for instant starts.
*   **Native Bridge**: `SupertonicTTS.kt` exposes thread-safe methods for `initialize()` and `generateAudio()`.
*   **Text Normalization**: A dedicated `TextNormalizer` class handles complex patterns (e.g., "$2.5bn" -> "two point five billion dollars") to ensure natural reading.

## Building and Running

### Prerequisites
*   **Android Studio** or **Gradle** command line tools.
*   **JDK 17**.
*   **Git LFS** (ensure `assets/` in the project root are downloaded).

### Termux Setup (One-time)
If building on Termux, run the setup script to install dependencies and configure the environment:
```bash
./setup_termux_build.sh
```

### Build Commands
To build the debug APK:
```bash
# First, ensure JNI libs are compiled
./compile_jni_libs.sh

# Then build the APK (using system gradle in Termux)
cd android
gradle assembleDebug
```

### Setup on Device
1.  Install the app.
2.  Open **Supertonic** to initialize assets (wait for "Ready" status).
3.  (Optional) To use system-wide:
    *   Go to **Settings > Accessibility > Text-to-speech output**.
    *   Select **Preferred engine** and choose **Supertonic TTS**.

## Development Conventions
*   **Language:** Kotlin (UI/Logic) and C++ (Native Core).
*   **UI Framework:** XML Layouts using **Material Components** (M3).
*   **Threading:** Heavy operations (synthesis, asset copying) run on `Dispatchers.IO`.
*   **Style:** Follows Material Design 3 guidelines (Semantic Colors, Shapes, Typography).

## Known Issues & Fixes
*   **Audio Cutoff (v2 Models):** The v2 Flow Matching models can sometimes underestimate sentence duration, causing the last word to be cut off.
    *   *Fix Applied:* The native engine (`cpp/` and `rust/`) now adds a **0.3s safety padding** to the synthesis duration and plays the full generative buffer without truncation.
    *   *Side Effect:* You might hear a faint echo or reverb tail at the end of sentences. This is preferable to cutting off words. To tune this, adjust the padding constant in `rust/src/helper.rs`.
